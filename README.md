# Portfolio
I first started out making the header with buttons and the profile. I kind of designed it after a facebook profile. Once I got the header done, i started by making what content there was going to be within the pages and setting it to a daddy div, ultimately making the divs show and hide when the functions are called so the pages "change". I didnt know what to put inside the "about me" page so I put a question text input asking what your favorite hobby was. 
I made a menu drop thing for the projects but i dont have any projects so i just put a message in it.
I put a contact me thing there with a drop down menu but Im not sure how to take input from the contact me to make a small drop menu with the info so I just left it as an interactable button for later.
also I forgot the links so I had to add that footer last minute. 

Also i found the footer didnt move with the page so i added to the function to switch the css to fit the different pages
